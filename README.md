This is a currency converter project.Where you can convert currencies of more than 100+countries 
API help is taken and I have learnt how to fetch it and work with it.
with the extensive use of JavaScript,HTML and CSS this has been made.
I have attached the countryList file where I have created it as a object for easy accessing.
The data has been fetched from API and converted into json model.
The API link may not work when you are viewing it and I didn't use feedback mechanism for the same.You can use any other API the logic remains the same.
